# INST126 Caesar Cipher
This is a basic Caesar Cipher script to encode or decrypt single or multiple strings at a time. 
I imported the sys module in order to smooth the user input process.
This program can be run at the command line. Navigate in the cmd/terminal/command line to the file location, and run it like this example: "Consolidation New.py" (encrypt/decrypt) (step) (string1) (string2) ...

Make sure to include the quotations because the file name has a space, and do not include the parentheses when inputting the desired output, step, and strings.
